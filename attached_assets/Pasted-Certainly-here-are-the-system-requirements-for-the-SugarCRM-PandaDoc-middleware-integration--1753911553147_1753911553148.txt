Certainly — here are the **system requirements** for the SugarCRM → PandaDoc middleware integration described:

---

# System Requirements

**Use Case**: Enable SugarCRM users to generate PandaDoc documents from within a CRM record, with field mapping, token support, and webhook-driven workflows.

---

## 1. **Core Functional Requirements**

### A. Document Generation

* A button in SugarCRM triggers a `POST` request to the middleware with:

  * SugarCRM record ID
  * (Optional) record module (e.g., `opportunities`)
  * Tenant identifier (for multi-tenant support)
* Middleware pulls full record details from SugarCRM via REST API
* Middleware applies pre-configured field mappings
* Middleware creates a PandaDoc document from a static template using the mapped tokens
* Middleware returns the document link and/or ID

### B. Token & Field Mapping Support

* System must support:

  * Field mapping between SugarCRM fields and PandaDoc tokens
  * Storage and retrieval of mapping configurations per tenant
  * Real-time generation of PandaDoc-compatible merge field tokens based on SugarCRM schema

### C. Webhook Workflow Handling

* Middleware must listen to PandaDoc webhook events (e.g., document viewed, signed)
* Webhooks must be verified using a shared secret (HMAC)
* Configurable logic to define workflows per tenant (e.g., if “signed,” then update SugarCRM field)
* Workflows must support:

  * IF/THEN/ELSE logic
  * Multiple actions per event
  * JSON-based config and optional visual UI

---

## 2. **System Architecture Requirements**

### A. Middleware Application

* REST-based middleware hosted on cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, Render, or similar)
* Built using Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/FastAPI), or similar backend framework
* Modular architecture separating:

  * Routes (API endpoints)
  * Services (CRM and PandaDoc logic)
  * Utilities (mapping, auth, transformation)
  * Config and tenant store

### B. API Integrations

* SugarCRM

  * REST API access
  * OAuth2 authentication or long-lived token storage
* PandaDoc

  * REST API v2 access
  * API Key stored in environment variables or secret store
  * Webhook support with secure HMAC validation

---

## 3. **Tenant Management Requirements**

* Ability to store and manage configuration per tenant/client:

  * API credentials (encrypted)
  * Field mappings
  * Workflow rules
  * Template IDs
  * Webhook secrets
* Multi-tenant safe: isolated configs and credentials

---

## 4. **Security Requirements**

* All secrets stored securely in environment variables or secret manager
* HTTPS required for all endpoints
* HMAC verification of all PandaDoc webhook payloads
* Access control if UI or admin panel is provided (e.g., API keys or login)

---

## 5. **Operational & Logging Requirements**

* Logging of all inbound and outbound API requests (with redacted sensitive data)
* Logging of webhook events
* Error handling and retries for transient API failures
* Health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`) for uptime monitoring
* Retry queue for failed webhook events (optional)

---

## 6. **Optional Admin UI Requirements**

* Allow non-technical users to:

  * Define field mappings via dropdown or field selector
  * Configure workflows (drag and drop or form-based IF/THEN)
  * View logs of past document creation attempts or webhook events

---

## 7. **Deployment & Hosting Requirements**

* Must be deployable to Heroku, AWS Lambda (via serverless), Render, or GCP Cloud Run
* CI/CD pipeline must support:

  * Linting
  * Testing
  * Environment variable management

Would you like this converted into a more formal PRD (Product Requirements Document) format or split into MVP vs. Phase 2 requirements?
